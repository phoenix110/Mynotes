Kubernetes 1.15 consists of**25 enhancements**: 2 moving to stable, 13 in beta, and 10 in alpha. The main themes of this release are:

#### Continuous Improvement[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#continuous-improvement)

*   Project sustainability is not just about features. Many SIGs have been working on improving test coverage, ensuring the basics stay reliable, and stability of the core feature set and working on maturing existing features and cleaning up the backlog.

#### Extensibility[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#extensibility)

*   The community has been asking for continuing support of extensibility, so this cycle features more work around CRDs and API Machinery. Most of the enhancements in this cycle were from SIG API Machinery and related areas.

### Extensibility around core Kubernetes APIs[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#extensibility-around-core-kubernetes-apis)

#### CustomResourceDefinitions Pruning[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#customresourcedefinitions-pruning)

To enforce both data consistency and security, Kubernetes performs pruning, or the automatic removal of unknown fields in objects sent to a Kubernetes API. An “unknown” field is one that is not specified in the OpenAPI validation schema. This behavior is already in place for native resources and ensures only data structures specified by the CRD developer are persisted to etcd. It will be available as a beta feature in Kubernetes 1.15.

Pruning is activated by setting`spec.preserveUnknownFields: false`in the CustomResourceDefinition. A future apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 variant of CRDs will enforce pruning.

Pruning requires that CRD developer provides complete, structural validation schemas, either at the top-level or for all versions of the CRD.

#### CustomResourceDefinition Defaulting[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#customresourcedefinition-defaulting)

CustomResourceDefinitions also have new support for defaulting, with defaults specified using the`default`keyword in the OpenAPI validation schema. Defaults are set for unspecified fields in an object sent to the API, and when reading from etcd.

Defaulting will be available as alpha in Kubernetes 1.15 and requires structural schemas.

#### CustomResourceDefinition OpenAPI Publishing[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#customresourcedefinition-openapi-publishing)

OpenAPI specs for native types have long been served at /openapi/v2, and they are consumed by a number of components, notably kubectl client-side validation, kubectl explain and OpenAPI based client generators.

With Kubernetes 1.15 as beta, OpenAPI schemas are also published for CRDs, as long as their schemas are structural.

These changes are reflected in the following Kubernetes enhancements: ([#383](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/383)), ([#575](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/575)), ([#492](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/492)), ([#598](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/598)), ([#692](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/692)), ([#95](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/95)), ([#995](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/995)), ([#956](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/956))

### Cluster Lifecycle Stability and Usability Improvements[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#cluster-lifecycle-stability-and-usability-improvements)

Work on making Kubernetes installation, upgrade and configuration even more robust has been a major focus for this cycle for SIG Cluster Lifecycle (see the May 6, 2019[Community Update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QUOsQxfEfHlMq4lPjlK2ewQHsr9peEKymDw5_XwZm8Q/edit?usp=sharing)). Bug fixes across bare metal tooling and production-ready user stories, such as the high availability use cases have been given priority for 1.15.

kubeadm, the cluster lifecycle building block, continues to receive features and stability work required for bootstrapping production clusters efficiently. kubeadm has promoted high availability (HA) capability to beta, allowing users to use the familiar`kubeadm init`and`kubeadm join`commands to[configure and deploy an HA control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/). An entire new test suite has been created specifically for ensuring these features will stay stable over time.

Certificate management has become more robust in 1.15, with kubeadm now seamlessly rotating all your certificates (on upgrades) before they expire. Check the[kubeadm documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/dev-1.15/content/en/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-alpha.md)for information on how to manage your certificates.

The kubeadm configuration file API is moving from v1beta1 to v1beta2 in 1.15.

These changes are reflected in the following Kubernetes enhancements: ([#357](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/357)), ([#970](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/970))

### Continued improvement of CSI[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#continued-improvement-of-csi)

In Kubernetes v1.15, SIG Storage continued work to[enable migration of in-tree volume plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625)to the Container Storage Interface (CSI). SIG Storage worked on bringing CSI to feature parity with in-tree functionality, including functionality like resizing, inline volumes, and more. SIG Storage introduces new alpha functionality in CSI that doesn’t exist in the Kubernetes Storage subsystem yet, like volume cloning.

Volume cloning enables users to specify another PVC as a “DataSource” when provisioning a new volume. If the underlying storage system supports this functionality and implements the “CLONE\_VOLUME” capability in its CSI driver, then the new volume becomes a clone of the source volume.

These changes are reflected in the following Kubernetes enhancements: ([#625](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625))

#### Additional Notable Feature Updates[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#additional-notable-feature-updates)

*   Support for go modules in Kubernetes Core.
*   Continued preparation for cloud provider extraction and code organization. The cloud provider code has been moved to kubernetes/legacy-cloud-providers for easier removal later and external consumption.
*   Kubectl[get and describe](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/515)now works with extensions
*   Nodes now support[third party monitoring plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/606).
*   A new[Scheduling Framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/624)for schedule plugins is now Alpha.
*   ExecutionHook API[designed to trigger hook commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/962)in containers is now Alpha.
*   Continued deprecation of extensions/v1beta1, apps/v1beta1, and apps/v1beta2 APIs; these extensions will be retired in 1.16!
